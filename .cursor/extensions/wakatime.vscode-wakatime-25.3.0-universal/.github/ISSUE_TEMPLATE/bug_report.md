!!! MUST READ: Bug reports without an error message will be ignored !!!

Find a non-backoff error message from your ~/.wakatime/wakatime.log file or vscode dev console window. If there is none, enable debug mode and reproduce the bug to trigger an error message. Make sure it's not a backoff message.

If your error message contains "won't send heartbeat due to backoff" then delete your `~/.wakatime/wakatime-internal.cfg` file to trigger an API connection so we can see the real error message.
